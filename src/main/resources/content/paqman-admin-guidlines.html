<h2>Step 1: Understand the paqman philosophy</h2>
paqman is designed to facilitate the rapid roll-out and maintainance of practical know-how across an organization.  It favors:
<ul>
   <li>human judgement over machine grading</li>
   <li>practical demonstrations over reading, tests & course-work</li>
</ul>

In order for a qualification program to be successful:
<ul>
    <li>It should have a well defined, specific focus</li>
    <li>This focus should be the aquisition of a demonstratable capability</li>
    <li>The program should be small enough to be maintainable for the administrator</li>
    <li>The administrator's maintainance cost should be small ... less than the time they would otherwise take to train 2 people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Establish The Scope of Your Qualification Program</h2>

A qualification program should be focused on one particular skill or capability, where that skill or capability can be detected by means of a brief "practical" examination.

The first step in establishing the focus of your program is to choose a name and a description:

<ol>
<li><b>name</b>: Identify the skillset/capability that the course is focused on.  Then, find a short, memorable description of the kind of person that has this capability.</li>
<li><b>description</b>: Identify the contexts in which you need to track the acquisition and maintainence of this capability.  It should fit in the following form: "you should have this if you _________"</li>
</ol>

Example:
<blockquote>
"break-room barrista": you should have this is if you operate the industrial coffee machines in the break room
</blockquote>



<h2>Step 3: Build the first version of the program</h2>

A qualification program consists of one or more hunks.  
There are 2 types of hunks:
   <ul>
     <li><span class="list-title">challenge</span> <span class="list-description">A valid program must have at least one 'challenge' hunk.  A challenge consists of a description of how one can go about prooving that they know/are-able-to-do one or more aspects of the overall program capability</span></li>
     <li><span class="list-title">information</span> <span class="list-description">An informational hunk does not require any action on behalf of the challenger; it is provided for informational purposes only, and may or may not need to be read/seen/heard by a given challenger.</span></li>
   </ul>

Tips:
<ul>
<li>
Break apart larger programs into multiple challenges.  Having more than one challenge has the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>When you make edits, there will be less thrash for those who have already completed the program, as they will only have to re-take the challenges that have changed.</li>
    <li>It will be easier for first-time challengers, as they will be able to tackle the program in more manageable chunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Favor videos over written material ... it's easier to consume, more like face-to-face communication, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step 4: Maintain the program</h2>
