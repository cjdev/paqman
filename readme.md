PAQMAN: A capability aquisition and maintainance tool

As someone who is responsible for introducing something new/updated to the department, 
I need a way to know whether the information is actually making its way to the people who need to know it,
So that I can faithfully discharge my duty to let everyone know.

As someone who needs to know the "right" way to do something, 
I need a way to know whether I know it, 
so that I can keep from unknowingly doing the wrong thing.
